# Teleport Example UI

This repository provides an example UI that illustrates how a front-end can be built on on top of
[teleport-sdk](https://github.com/makerdao/xdomain/tree/master/packages/teleport-sdk).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
